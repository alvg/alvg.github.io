 ate an Adaptive Quality Attribute Relationship Matrix\, by Unnati Shah\n\n
 Speakers: (1) Shrikanth  (2) Unnati Shah\n\nAbstracts (1) Software Enginee
 ring practitioners and researchers often suffer from the data-hungry presu
 mption that more data is inherently better. A recent study identified a st
 artling trend among 240 open-source GitHub projects with 1.2 million commi
 ts (changes). We find that the information (software defects) in those pro
 jects ""clump"" towards the earliest parts of the project. Therefore\, a m
 achine learning model built only from the first 150 commits once predicted
  post-release defects for the rest of the project life-cycle.  Such a data
 -lite process performed on par or better than the state-of-the-art alterna
 tives.Hence\, if data has the most information in some small region\, perh
 aps a model learned from that region would suffice for the rest of the pro
 ject. Using this data-lite approach\, we can build machine learning models
  quickly and importantly early in the project life cycle. ICSE 2021 - http

 ion. Why? How?(2) [Context/Motivation] A critical success factor in Requir
 ements Engineering (RE) involves recognizing conflicts in Quality Requirem
 ents (QRs). Nowadays\, Quality Attributes Relationship Matrix (QARM) is ut
 ilized to identify the conflicts in QRs. The static QARM represents how on
 e Quality Attribute (QA) undermines or supports to achieve other QAs. [Que
 stion/Problem] However\, emerging technology discovers new QAs. Requiremen
 ts analysts need to invest significant time and non-trivial human effort t
 o acquire knowledge for the newly discovered QAs and influence among them.
  This process involves searching and analyzing a large set of quality docu
 ments from literature and industries. In addition\, the use of static QARM
 s\, without knowing the purpose of the QRs in the system may lead to false
  conflict identification. Rather than taking all QAs\, domain-specific QAs
  are of great concern for the system being developed. [Principal ideas/res
 ults] In this paper\, we propose an approach which is aimed to build an ad
 aptive QARM semi-automatically. We empirically evaluate the approach and r
 eport an analysis of the generated QARM. We achieve 85.67% recall\, 59.07%
  precision and 69.14% F-measure to acquire knowledge for QAs. [Contributio
 ns] We provide an algorithm to acquire knowledge for domain-specific QAs a
 nd construct an adaptive QARM from available unconstrained natural languag
 e documents and web search engines.Publication Venue: REFSQ 2020: Requirem
