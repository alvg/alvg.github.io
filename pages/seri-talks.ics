 anth Narayanaswamy Chandrasekaran  (2) A Semi-automated Approach to Genera
 te an Adaptive Quality Attribute Relationship Matrix\, by Unnati Shah\n\nS
 peakers: (1) Shrikanth  (2) Unnati Shah\n\nAbstracts (1) Software Engineer
 ing practitioners and researchers often suffer from the data-hungry presum
 ption that more data is inherently better. A recent study identified a sta
 rtling trend among 240 open-source GitHub projects with 1.2 million commit
 s (changes). We find that the information (software defects) in those proj
 ects ""clump"" towards the earliest parts of the project. Therefore\, a ma
 chine learning model built only from the first 150 commits once predicted 
 post-release defects for the rest of the project life-cycle.  Such a data-
 lite process performed on par or better than the state-of-the-art alternat
 ives.Hence\, if data has the most information in some small region\, perha
 ps a model learned from that region would suffice for the rest of the proj
 ect. Using this data-lite approach\, we can build machine learning models 
 quickly and importantly early in the project life cycle. ICSE 2021 - https
 ://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13071.pdf. Early Life Cycle Software Defect Predicti
 on. Why? How?(2) [Context/Motivation] A critical success factor in Require
 ments Engineering (RE) involves recognizing conflicts in Quality Requireme
 nts (QRs). Nowadays\, Quality Attributes Relationship Matrix (QARM) is uti
 lized to identify the conflicts in QRs. The static QARM represents how one
  Quality Attribute (QA) undermines or supports to achieve other QAs. [Ques
 tion/Problem] However\, emerging technology discovers new QAs. Requirement
 s analysts need to invest significant time and non-trivial human effort to
  acquire knowledge for the newly discovered QAs and influence among them. 
 This process involves searching and analyzing a large set of quality docum
 ents from literature and industries. In addition\, the use of static QARMs
 \, without knowing the purpose of the QRs in the system may lead to false 
 conflict identification. Rather than taking all QAs\, domain-specific QAs 
 are of great concern for the system being developed. [Principal ideas/resu
 lts] In this paper\, we propose an approach which is aimed to build an ada
 ptive QARM semi-automatically. We empirically evaluate the approach and re
 port an analysis of the generated QARM. We achieve 85.67% recall\, 59.07% 
 precision and 69.14% F-measure to acquire knowledge for QAs. [Contribution
 s] We provide an algorithm to acquire knowledge for domain-specific QAs an
 d construct an adaptive QARM from available unconstrained natural language
  documents and web search engines.Publication Venue: REFSQ 2020: Requireme
