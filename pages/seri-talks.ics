 Semi-automated Approach to Generate an Adaptive Quality Attribute Relation
 ship Matrix\, by Unnati Shah\n  (1) Shrikanth is a Ph.D. (Computer Scien
 ce) graduate from NC State (Advised by Dr. Tim Menzies) with ten years of 
 industry experience. He has a research interest in Software Engineering (s
 oftware defect prediction) and Machine Learning. He is employed full-time 
 with Oracle America\, Inc to build tools to improve developer experiences 
 for next-generation cloud infrastructure. Previously\, he was a Technology
  R&D Specialist at Accenture Labs\, Software Engineering group India. Befo
 re that\, he was a Software Engineer and Senior Systems Engineer at ABB In
 dia Ltd and Infosys Ltd. In the last two summers\, he interned (research) 
 at Fujitsu Laboratories of America and Microsoft. He is an engineering gr
 aduate with a track record of innovations (3 granted patents) and publishe
 d papers at premier avenues. Website: https://snaraya7.github.io/ (2)  
 Unnati Shah is an assistant professor in the department of computer scienc
 e at Utica University\, New York\, USA.  She completed her doctorate from
  NIT\, Surat. Her research focuses resolving ambiguities and specification
  of Non-functional requirements.\nAbstracts (1) Software Engineering prac
 titioners and researchers often suffer from the data-hungry presumption th
 at more data is inherently better. A recent study identified a startling t
 rend among 240 open-source GitHub projects with 1.2 million commits (chang
 es). We find that the information (software defects) in those projects ""c
 lump"" towards the earliest parts of the project. Therefore\, a machine le
 arning model built only from the first 150 commits once predicted post-rel
 ease defects for the rest of the project life-cycle.  Such a data-lite pr
 ocess performed on par or better than the state-of-the-art alternatives.He
 nce\, if data has the most information in some small region\, perhaps a mo
 del learned from that region would suffice for the rest of the project. Us
 ing this data-lite approach\, we can build machine learning models quickly
  and importantly early in the project life cycle. ICSE 2021 - https://arx
 iv.org/pdf/2011.13071.pdf. Early Life Cycle Software Defect Prediction. Wh
 y? How?(2) [Context/Motivation] A critical success factor in Requirements 
 Engineering (RE) involves recognizing conflicts in Quality Requirements (Q
 Rs). Nowadays\, Quality Attributes Relationship Matrix (QARM) is utilized 
 to identify the conflicts in QRs. The static QARM represents how one Quali
 ty Attribute (QA) undermines or supports to achieve other QAs. [Question/
 Problem] However\, emerging technology discovers new QAs. Requirements ana
 lysts need to invest significant time and non-trivial human effort to acqu
 ire knowledge for the newly discovered QAs and influence among them. This 
 process involves searching and analyzing a large set of quality documents 
 from literature and industries. In addition\, the use of static QARMs\, wi
 thout knowing the purpose of the QRs in the system may lead to false confl
 ict identification. Rather than taking all QAs\, domain-specific QAs are o
 f great concern for the system being developed. [Principal ideas/results]
  In this paper\, we propose an approach which is aimed to build an adaptiv
 e QARM semi-automatically. We empirically evaluate the approach and report
  an analysis of the generated QARM. We achieve 85.67% recall\, 59.07% prec
 ision and 69.14% F-measure to acquire knowledge for QAs. [Contributions] 
 We provide an algorithm to acquire knowledge for domain-specific QAs and c
 onstruct an adaptive QARM from available unconstrained natural language do
 cuments and web search engines.Publication Venue: REFSQ 2020: Requirements
