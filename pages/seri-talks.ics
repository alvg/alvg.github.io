 bstracts (1) Software Engineering practitioners and researchers often suff
 er from the data-hungry presumption that more data is inherently better. A
  recent study identified a startling trend among 240 open-source GitHub pr
 ojects with 1.2 million commits (changes). We find that the information (s
 oftware defects) in those projects ""clump"" towards the earliest parts of
  the project. Therefore\, a machine learning model built only from the fir
 st 150 commits once predicted post-release defects for the rest of the pro
 ject life-cycle.  Such a data-lite process performed on par or better than
  the state-of-the-art alternatives.Hence\, if data has the most informatio
 n in some small region\, perhaps a model learned from that region would su
 ffice for the rest of the project. Using this data-lite approach\, we can 
 build machine learning models quickly and importantly early in the project
  life cycle. ICSE 2021 - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13071.pdf. Early Life 
 Cycle Software Defect Prediction. Why? How?(2) [Context/Motivation] A crit
 ical success factor in Requirements Engineering (RE) involves recognizing 
 conflicts in Quality Requirements (QRs). Nowadays\, Quality Attributes Rel
 ationship Matrix (QARM) is utilized to identify the conflicts in QRs. The 
 static QARM represents how one Quality Attribute (QA) undermines or suppor
 ts to achieve other QAs. [Question/Problem] However\, emerging technology 
 discovers new QAs. Requirements analysts need to invest significant time a
 nd non-trivial human effort to acquire knowledge for the newly discovered 
 QAs and influence among them. This process involves searching and analyzin
 g a large set of quality documents from literature and industries. In addi
 tion\, the use of static QARMs\, without knowing the purpose of the QRs in
  the system may lead to false conflict identification. Rather than taking 
 all QAs\, domain-specific QAs are of great concern for the system being de
 veloped. [Principal ideas/results] In this paper\, we propose an approach 
 which is aimed to build an adaptive QARM semi-automatically. We empiricall
 y evaluate the approach and report an analysis of the generated QARM. We a
 chieve 85.67% recall\, 59.07% precision and 69.14% F-measure to acquire kn
 owledge for QAs. [Contributions] We provide an algorithm to acquire knowle
 dge for domain-specific QAs and construct an adaptive QARM from available 
 unconstrained natural language documents and web search engines.Publicatio
