 1) Software Engineering practitioners and researchers often suffer from th
 e data-hungry presumption that more data is inherently better. A recent st
 udy identified a startling trend among 240 open-source GitHub projects wit
 h 1.2 million commits (changes). We find that the information (software de
 fects) in those projects ""clump"" towards the earliest parts of the proje
 ct. Therefore\, a machine learning model built only from the first 150 com
 mits once predicted post-release defects for the rest of the project life-
 cycle.  Such a data-lite process performed on par or better than the stat
 e-of-the-art alternatives.Hence\, if data has the most information in some
  small region\, perhaps a model learned from that region would suffice for
  the rest of the project. Using this data-lite approach\, we can build mac
 hine learning models quickly and importantly early in the project life cyc
 le. ICSE 2021 - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13071.pdf. Early Life Cycle So
 ftware Defect Prediction. Why? How?(2) [Context/Motivation] A critical suc
 cess factor in Requirements Engineering (RE) involves recognizing conflict
 s in Quality Requirements (QRs). Nowadays\, Quality Attributes Relationshi
 p Matrix (QARM) is utilized to identify the conflicts in QRs. The static Q
 ARM represents how one Quality Attribute (QA) undermines or supports to ac
 hieve other QAs. [Question/Problem] However\, emerging technology discove
 rs new QAs. Requirements analysts need to invest significant time and non-
 trivial human effort to acquire knowledge for the newly discovered QAs and
  influence among them. This process involves searching and analyzing a lar
 ge set of quality documents from literature and industries. In addition\, 
 the use of static QARMs\, without knowing the purpose of the QRs in the sy
 stem may lead to false conflict identification. Rather than taking all QAs
 \, domain-specific QAs are of great concern for the system being developed
 . [Principal ideas/results] In this paper\, we propose an approach which 
 is aimed to build an adaptive QARM semi-automatically. We empirically eval
 uate the approach and report an analysis of the generated QARM. We achieve
  85.67% recall\, 59.07% precision and 69.14% F-measure to acquire knowledg
 e for QAs. [Contributions] We provide an algorithm to acquire knowledge f
 or domain-specific QAs and construct an adaptive QARM from available uncon
 strained natural language documents and web search engines.Publication Ven
