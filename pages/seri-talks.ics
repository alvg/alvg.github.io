  Diptikalyan Saha(2)  Symbolic Execution in Testing Industrial Application
 s\, by Sujit Kumar Chakrabarti\n\nSpeakers: (1) Dr. Diptikalyan Saha is Sr
 . Technical Staff Member at IBM Research Lab in India. His current researc
 h focuses on AI Testing where he is trying to ensure Trustworthy AI by dev
 eloping novel techniques to test\, debug and repair AI models and applying
  AI techniques to improve traditional software testing. Dipti holds a Ph.D
 . in Computer Science from the State University of New York at Stony Brook
 . He\n\nAbstracts (1) The proliferation of web-based applications has incr
 eased the need for the testing of web services. With the adoption of web s
 ervice standards such as REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (
 Simple Object Access Protocol)\, it has become easier for developers to bu
 ild and consume APIs. The testing of REST APIs has been a topic of interes
 t in the recent past. However\, these studies mostly focus on the testing 
 of REST APIs with the aim of finding bugs in the system under test. Functi
 onal testing involves testing the functional behavior of the system under 
 test. In this work\, we aim to automatically generate realistic functional
  test cases which can even be used for regression. Functional testing seek
 s to cover valid functional scenarios\, the notion we concretely define an
 d present an algorithm to generate nominal/valid test cases following a fu
 nctional sequence of operations. We used a resource-based grouping strateg
 y\, a novel producer-consumer dependency inference algorithm\, and a langu
 age model-based sequencing algorithm to generate an operational sequence s
 uitable for functional test cases.(2)  We discuss our recent work on using
  symbolic execution for generating test inputs for industrial embedded sys
 tems. We consider a specific class of applications we term as acyclic core
  applications\, a control flow structure that represents a fairly large nu
 mber of embedded applications. Our goal is not to achieve full coverage bu
 t to reach specific parts of the control flow graph as early as possible. 
 Our symbolic execution approach proceeds along a single path at a time and
  backtracks on meeting infeasibility always trying to optimise the path so
  that the targets are covered early. We discuss the basic framework\, and 
 then present two improvements on that\, primarily to do good backtracking.
  The first method is based on probabilistic calculations based on past run
 s. The second method is based on a Q table based learning technique akin t
 o reinforcement learning.\n\nRegistration: Use this link to register for t
 he talk.  Registration is required to attend the talk\, which takes only 1
  minute. Register any time before the talk\, but register early to ensure 
 your spot! After registering\, you will receive a confirmation email conta
 ining information about joining the meeting.
