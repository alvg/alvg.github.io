 jQT09\nTitle: Verification of Concurrent Programs under Release Acquire\nS
 peaker: Krishna S\nAbstract: This is an overview of some recent work on th
 e verification of concurrent programs. Traditionally concurrent programs a
 re interpreted under sequential consistency (SC). Eventhough SC is very in
 tuitive and easy to use\, modern multiprocessors do not employ SC for perf
 ormance reasons\, and instead use so called "weak memory models". Some of 
 the well known weak memory models in vogue among modern multiprcessor arch
 itectures are Intel x-86\, IBM POWER and ARM. The use of weak memory is al
 so prevelant in the C11 model\, leading to the release acquire fragment of
  C11. This talk is on the verification of concurrent programs under the re
 lease acquire (RA) semantics. The main focus of the talk will be on non pa
 rameterized programs under RA\, and I will briefly discuss results in the 
 parameterized setting. In the non parameterized setting\, we show that the
  reachability problem for RA is undecidable even in the case where the inp
 ut program is finite-state\, closing a long standing open problem. What wo
 rks well for this class is under approximate reachability\, in the form of
  bounded view switching\, an analogue of bounded context switching\, relev
 ant to RA. In the parameterized setting\, the first observation is that th
 e semantics of RA can be simplified\, lending to a better complexity for v
 erification. Further\, safety verification is PSPACE-complete for the case
  where the distinguished threads are loop-free\, and jumps to NEXPTIME-com
 plete for the setting where an unrestricted distinguished ego thread inter
 acts with the environment threads. This talk is based on papers that appea
 red in PLDI'19 (joint with Parosh Abdulla\, Mohamed Faouzi Atig and Jatin 
 Arora)\, PODC'22 (joint with Roland Meyer and Adwait Godbole) as well as s
 ome unpublished work.
