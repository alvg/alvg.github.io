 rning and Guessing Winning Policies in LTL Synthesis via Semantics\n\nSpea
 ker: Jan Křetínský\n\nAbstract: We discuss a learning-based framework f
 or guessing a winning strategy in a parity game originating from a reactiv
 e synthesis problem for LTL. Its applications range from cases where the g
 ame's huge size prohibits rigorous approaches\, over increasing scalabilit
 y of rigorous synthesis\, to explainability of synthesized controllers. We
  discuss the advantages and caveats of these new avenues in synthesis. On 
 the technical level\, we describe (i) how to reflect the highly structured
  logical information in game's states\, the so-called semantic labelling\,
  coming from the recent LTL-to-automata translations\, and (ii) to do so b
 y learning from previously solved games\, bringing the solution process cl
 oser to human-like reasoning.
