 cifying and Verifying Correctness of Mergeable Replicated Data Types\n\nSp
 eaker: Kartik Nagar\n\nAbstract: Modern decentralized applications often u
 se multiple replicas/copies of data\, each of which can be independently o
 perated\, to minimize data access latency\, provide fault tolerance and im
 prove scalability. Mergeable Replicated Data Types (MRDTs) have emerged as
  a systematic approach to the problem of ensuring that replicas remain eve
 ntually consistent despite concurrent conflicting updates. MRDTs draw insp
 iration from the Git version control system\, where each update creates a 
 new version and any two versions can be merged explicitly through a user-d
 efined merge function. The full flexibility offered by MRDTs in terms of c
 reating and merging arbitrary versions severely complicates the design and
  development of correct MRDT implementations. In this talk\, I will presen
 t two orthogonal approaches for specification and verification of MRDTs: a
  highly expressive\, axiomatic event-based specification approach supporte
 d by a semi-automated verification procedure\, and a more intuitive (but r
 estrictive) linearizability based specification approach supported by full
 y automated verification.
