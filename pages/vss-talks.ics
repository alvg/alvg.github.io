 ifying Programs in Weak Memory Models with Persistency\n\nSpeaker: Prakash
  Saivasan\n\nAbstract: In this talk\, we will consider the problem of veri
 fying concurrent programs. In here\, we are given a set of programs that c
 ommunicate through shared memory and a specification\, we wish to algorith
 mically check if the programs violate the specification. The programmers\,
  while writing code usually assume that the memory operations are immediat
 e (referred to as sequential consistency). However\, the modern day archit
 ectures\, to optimise the running time\, re-order the memory operations in
  a non-trivial manner. This leads to various memory models such as TSO\, P
 SO and so on. We will walk through some of these memory models during the 
 talk. The recent intel processor introduced persistency mechanism that all
 ows for the writes to be archived. This can then be used to restart the co
 mputation in case of a crash. The main focus of the talk will be how to ve
 rify programs when persistency is combined with weak memory.
