 olving Nondeterminism by Chance\n\nSpeaker: Soumyajit Paul\n\nAbstract: Hi
 story-deterministic automata are those in which nondeterministic choices c
 an be correctly resolved stepwise: there is a strategy to select a continu
 ation of a run given the next input letter so that if the overall input wo
 rd admits some accepting run\, then the constructed run is also accepting.
  The notion of History Determinism (sometimes known as Good for Games) was
  introduced by Henzinger and Piterman in 2006 motivated by applications in
  reactive synthesis. Later\, it has been studied for several models such a
 s Pushdown systems\, Timed automata\, Vector Addition systems\, etc. Motiv
 ated by checking qualitative properties in probabilistic verification\, we
  introduce the setting where the resolver strategy can randomize and only 
 needs to succeed with lower-bounded probability. In this talk\, I will pre
 sent our work on stochastic resolution of nondeterministic automata. I wil
 l discuss the expressiveness of stochastically-resolvable automata as well
  as our complexity results for deciding stochastic resolvability. In parti
 cular\, we show that it is undecidable to check if a given NFA is stochast
 ically resolvable with a given threshold. The problem however becomes deci
 dable for the class of finitely-ambiguous automata. We also consider the r
 elated question of deciding whether an automata is resolvable with any pos
 itive threshold. We show that this problem is decidable for automata over 
 unary alphabet as well as for finitely-ambiguous automata. I will present 
 our complexity results for several well-studied classes of automata and al
 so discuss natural extensions of some of these results to automata for ome
 ga regular languages. I will conclude with some interesting open questions
 . This is based on joint work with David Purser\, Sven Schewe\, Qiyi Tang\
 , Patrick Totzke and Di-de Yen.
