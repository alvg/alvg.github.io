 ving Rabin games using Colourful Universal Trees\n\nSpeaker: Thejaswini Ra
 ghavan\n\nAbstract: To solve Church's synthesis problem for omega-regular 
 specifications\, represented by non-deterministic Buechi automata\, there 
 are two polynomial-time equivalent approaches: either reduce it to the emp
 tiness problem for Rabin tree automata or solve a Rabin game. In this talk
 \, we will see how one can solve Rabin games faster with an improvement by
  a super quadratic dependence on the number of Rabin pairs from the curren
 tly best known run time obtained by converting a Rabin game into a parity 
 game\, while simultaneously improving its exponential space requirement. O
 ur main technical ingredient is a characterisation of progress measures fo
 r Rabin games using colourful trees and a combinatorial construction of su
 ccinctly-represented\, universal colourful trees. Colourful universal tree
 s are generalisations of universal trees used by Jurdzinski and Lazic (201
 7) to solve parity games\, as well as of Rabin progress measures of Klarlu
 nd and Kozen (1991). Further\, we will also discuss lower bounds for solvi
 ng Rabin games that show that our algorithm is tight subject to the expone
 ntial time hypothesis\, reproving a result of Calude et al. (2022). The fi
 rst part of the talk is based on joint work with Rupak Majumdar and Irmak 
 Saglam\, accepted at TACAS 2024 and the last part about the lower bounds i
 s based on joint work with Antonio Casares\, Marcin Pilipczuk\, Michal Pil
 ipczuk\, Ueverton S. Souza\, published at SOSA 2024.
