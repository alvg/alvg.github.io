 ding Games on Graphs - In theory and in practice.\n\nSpeaker: Suman Sadhuk
 han\n\nAbstract: In a two-player zero-sum graph game\, the players move a 
 token throughout the game\, producing an infinite play\, which determines 
 the winner of the game. Bidding games are graph games in which in each tur
 n\, a bidding (auction) determines which player moves the token: the playe
 rs have budgets\, and in each turn\, both players simultaneously submit th
 e bids that do not exceed the available budgets. The higher bidder moves t
 he token\, and pays the bid to the lower bidder (called Richman bidding). 
 The standard solution concept of interest in bidding games are threshold b
 udgets: the necessary and sufficient budget for winning the game. In this 
 survey talk\, on the theoretical side\, we will explore discrete bidding g
 ames\, where the keyword discrete stands for the bids having a fixed granu
 larity. We obtain membership in NP âˆ© coNP for solving parity bidding gam
 es with exponentially succinct representation. This will be followed by ou
 r newly proposed application of bidding games to a decentralized synthesis
  problem for multi-objective decision making. Here\, synthesized policies 
 express their scheduling urgency via bids and a bounded budget guarantees 
 long-run fairness. Moreover\, our proposed solution framework is modular\,
  in the sense that if one objective changes\, we may still combine the pol
 icy for the other objective without having the need to recompute it from s
 cratch. These works have been in collaboration with Guy Avni and Kaushik M
 allik.
