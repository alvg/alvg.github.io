 rams with Unbounded Inputs\nSpeaker: Mahesh Viswanathan\nAbstract: We intr
 oduce an automata model for describing interesting classes of differential
  privacy mechanisms/algorithms that include known mechanisms from the lite
 rature. These automata can model algorithms whose inputs can be an unbound
 ed sequence of real-valued query answers. We consider the problem of check
 ing whether there exists a constant $d$ such that the algorithm described 
 by these automata are $d\\epsilon$-differentially private for all positive
  values of the privacy budget parameter $\\epsilon$. We show that this pro
 blem can be decided in time linear in the automaton's size by identifying 
 a necessary and sufficient condition on the underlying graph of the automa
 ton. This paper's results are the first decidability results known for alg
 orithms with an unbounded number of query answers taking values from the s
 et of reals. This is joint work with Rohit Chadha and Prasad Sistla.
