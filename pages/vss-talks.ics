 ation of Concurrent Programs under Release Acquire -- Part II      
     (see the video of part I here)\nSpeaker: Krishna S\nAbstract: Thes
 e talks (part I and part II) are an overview of some recent work on the ve
 rification of concurrent programs. Traditionally concurrent programs are i
 nterpreted under sequential consistency (SC). Eventhough SC is very intuit
 ive and easy to use\, modern multiprocessors do not employ SC for performa
 nce reasons\, and instead use so called "weak memory models". Some of the 
 well known weak memory models in vogue among modern multiprocessor archite
 ctures are Intel x-86\, IBM POWER and ARM. The use of weak memory is also 
 prevalent in the C11 model\, leading to the release acquire fragment of C1
 1. This talk is on the verification of concurrent programs under the relea
 se acquire (RA) semantics. The main focus of the talk will be on non param
 eterized programs under RA\, and I will briefly discuss results in the par
 ameterized setting. In the non parameterized setting\, we show that the re
 achability problem for RA is undecidable even in the case where the input 
 program is finite-state\, closing a long standing open problem. What works
  well for this class is under approximate reachability\, in the form of bo
 unded view switching\, an analogue of bounded context switching\, relevant
  to RA. In the parameterized setting\, the first observation is that the s
 emantics of RA can be simplified\, lending to a better complexity for veri
 fication. Further\, safety verification is PSPACE-complete for the case wh
 ere the distinguished threads are loop-free\, and jumps to NEXPTIME-comple
 te for the setting where an unrestricted distinguished ego thread interact
 s with the environment threads. This talk is based on papers that appeared
  in PLDI'19 (joint with Parosh Abdulla\, Mohamed Faouzi Atig and Jatin Aro
 ra)\, PODC'22 (joint with Roland Meyer\, Adwait Godbole and Soham Chakrabo
 rty)\, and Arxiv'21 (with Roland Meyer and Adwait Godbole).
