 jQT09\nTitle: A Game of Pawns\nSpeaker: Shibashis Guha\nAbstract: We intro
 duce and study pawn games\; a class of two-player turn-based zero-sum game
 s in which the control of vertices changes dynamically throughout the game
 . Pawn games naturally model ongoing decision-making setting in which reso
 urces are transferable. Each vertex of a pawn game is owned by a pawn. In 
 each round of the game\, the pawns are partitioned between the two players
 . The player who moves the token from a vertex is the player who controls 
 the pawn that owns the vertex. A pawn game is equipped with a mechanism\, 
 which the players apply after each round in order to update the set of paw
 ns that they control. We define several grabbing-based mechanisms in which
  control of at most one pawn transfers at the end of each round. We study 
 the complexity of solving reachability pawn games\, where we parameterize 
 the problem by the mechanism that is being used and by restrictions on paw
 n ownership of vertices. For the positive news\, even though pawn games ar
 e exponentially-succinct turn-based games\, we identify some natural class
 es that can be solved in PTIME. For the negative news\, we identify some c
 lasses for which the problem is EXPTIME-complete. Our EXPTIME-hardness res
 ults are based on a class of games which we introduce and call Lock-and-Ke
 y games\, and which may be of independent interest. This is a joint work w
 ith Guy Avni and Pranav Ghorpade.
