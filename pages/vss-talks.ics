 -Based Invariant Inference and Its Relation to Concept Learning\n\nSpeaker
 : Sharon Shoham Buchbinder\n\nAbstract: In recent years SAT-based invarian
 t inference algorithms such as interpolation-based model checking and PDR/
 IC3 have proven to be extremely successful in practice. However\, the esse
 nce of their practical success and their performance guarantees are far le
 ss understood. This talk surveys results that establish formal connections
  and distinctions between SAT-based invariant inference and exact concept 
 learning with queries\, showing that learning techniques and algorithms ca
 n clarify foundational questions\, illuminate existing algorithms\, and su
 ggest new directions for efficient invariant inference.
