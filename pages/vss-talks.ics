 aker: Umang Mathur\nAbstract: Concurrent programs are notoriously hard to 
 write correctly\, as scheduling nondeterminism introduces subtle errors th
 at are both hard to detect and to reproduce. Data races are arguably the m
 ost insidious amongst concurrency bugs and extensive research efforts have
  been dedicated to effectively detect them. A data race occurs when memory
 -conflicting actions are executed concurrently. Consequently\, considerabl
 e effort has been made towards developing efficient techniques for race de
 tection. The preferred approach to detect data races is through dynamic an
 alysis\, where one observes an execution of a concurrent program and check
 s for the presence of data races in the execution observed. Traditional dy
 namic race detectors rely on Lamport's happens-before (HB) partial order\,
  which can be conservative and are often unable to discover simple data ra
 ces\, even after executing the program several times. Dynamic data race pr
 ediction aims to expose data races\, that can be otherwise missed by tradi
 tional dynamic race detectors (such as those based on HB)\, by inferring d
 ata races in alternate executions of the underlying program\, without re-e
 xecuting it. In this talk\, I will talk about the fundamentals of and rece
 nt algorithmic advances in data race prediction.
