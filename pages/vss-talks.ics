 kest Precondition Inference for Linear Array Programs\n\nSpeaker: Sumanth 
 Prabhu\n\nAbstract: The problem of precondition inference is to find a set
  of initial states from which all terminating executions of a given progra
 m reach states that satisfy a given postcondition. The weakest preconditio
 n refers to the largest such set of initial states. The weakest preconditi
 on is helpful in many practical problems around software development\, ver
 ification\, and testing. Hence\, its automatic inference is an important p
 roblem and has received considerable attention. However\, existing techniq
 ues find it challenging to handle programs with arrays. In this talk\, I w
 ill present our technique to find quantified weakest preconditions for pro
 grams with arrays. Our technique is effective on a class of programs calle
 d linear array programs. We prove that linear array programs' weakest prec
 ondition computation is undecidable. Nevertheless\, such programs often ap
 pear in practice. Hence\, many array works target them but for verificatio
 n\, not precondition inference. We propose a precondition inference techni
 que in the Infer-Check-Weaken framework. It first infers a precondition al
 ong with adequate inductive invariants. A maximality check follows to see 
 whether the precondition is the weakest. If not\, the precondition is weak
 ened. In this framework\, we present novel methods for each module. We exp
 erimentally show that our technique is significantly better than the state
 -of-the-art over a set of existing linear array programs. This talk is bas
 ed on our two papers from ESOP 2024 and TACAS 2024. The work is done in co
 llaboration with Deepak D'Souza (Indian Institute of Science)\, Grigory Fe
 dyukovich (Florida State University)\, Supratik Chakraborty (IIT Bombay)\,
  and R Venkatesh (TCS Research).
