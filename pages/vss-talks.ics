 ification of Concurrent Programs with Civl\n\nSpeaker: Shaz Qadeer\n\nAbst
 ract: The Civl verifier introduces layered refinement\, a new approach to 
 the construction of verified concurrent programs and their proofs. This ap
 proach simplifies and scales (human and automated) reasoning by enabling a
  concurrent program to be represented and manipulated at multiple layers o
 f abstraction. These abstraction layers are chained together via simple pr
 ogram transformations\; each transformation is justified by a collection o
 f automatically-checked verification conditions. Civl proofs are maintaina
 ble and reusable\, specifically eliminating the need to write complex inva
 riants on the low-level encoding of the concurrent program as a flat trans
 ition system. Civl has been used to construct verified low-level implement
 ations of complex systems such as a concurrent garbage collector\, a conse
 nsus protocol\, and shared-memory data structures.
