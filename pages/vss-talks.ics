 +: The Tools\, The Language\, and The Application\n\nSpeaker: Markus Kuppe
 \n\nAbstract: TLA+ is a language for formally specifying and verifying dis
 crete systems\, including distributed algorithms. Users describe the syste
 m as a state machine\, written in a language based on mathematical set the
 ory and temporal logic\, which also serves to express safety and liveness 
 properties. TLA+ comes with tools for computer-assisted verification\, inc
 luding two model checkers and an interactive proof system. TLA+ is used in
  academia and industry\, e.g.\, to verify data consistency in cloud applic
 ations. This talk will cover the theory behind TLA+ and how practitioners 
 can write TLA+ specifications with the help of verification tools. Additio
 nally\, we will discuss known limitations of the tools and outline current
  and future research opportunities.
