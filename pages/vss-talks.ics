 ation of Concurrent Programs under Release Acquire -- Part II      
     (see the video of part I here)\nSpeaker: Krishna S\nAbstract: This
  talk (part I and part II) is an overview of some recent work on the verif
 ication of concurrent programs. Traditionally concurrent programs are inte
 rpreted under sequential consistency (SC). Eventhough SC is very intuitive
  and easy to use\, modern multiprocessors do not employ SC for performance
  reasons\, and instead use so called "weak memory models". Some of the wel
 l known weak memory models in vogue among modern multiprocessor architectu
 res are Intel x-86\, IBM POWER and ARM. The use of weak memory is also pre
 valent in the C11 model\, leading to the release acquire fragment of C11. 
 This talk is on the verification of concurrent programs under the release 
 acquire (RA) semantics. The main focus of the talk will be on non paramete
 rized programs under RA\, and I will briefly discuss results in the parame
 terized setting. In the non parameterized setting\, we show that the reach
 ability problem for RA is undecidable even in the case where the input pro
 gram is finite-state\, closing a long standing open problem. What works we
 ll for this class is under approximate reachability\, in the form of bound
 ed view switching\, an analogue of bounded context switching\, relevant to
  RA. In the parameterized setting\, the first observation is that the sema
 ntics of RA can be simplified\, lending to a better complexity for verific
 ation. Further\, safety verification is PSPACE-complete for the case where
  the distinguished threads are loop-free\, and jumps to NEXPTIME-complete 
 for the setting where an unrestricted distinguished ego thread interacts w
 ith the environment threads. This talk is based on papers that appeared in
  PLDI'19 (joint with Parosh Abdulla\, Mohamed Faouzi Atig and Jatin Arora)
 \, PODC'22 (joint with Roland Meyer\, Adwait Godbole and Soham Chakraborty
 )\, and Arxiv'21 (with Roland Meyer and Adwait Godbole).
