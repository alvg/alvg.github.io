 ing Back Control: Formally Modelling a Compiler Intermediate Representatio
 n for GPU Computing\n\nSpeaker: Alastair Donaldson\n\nAbstract: We will pr
 esent our POPL 2023 work on using formal modelling and analysis techniques
  to understand and fix fundamental problems in the design of SPIR-V\, a co
 mpiler intermediate representation that is widely-used in GPU computing. A
 n innovation of SPIR-V is that it features special instructions that allow
  information about high level control flow constructs to be documented in 
 its otherwise-unstructured basic block-based representation. The idea is t
 hat compilers can exploit this information to generate efficient GPU-speci
 fic machine code. However\, the original definitions of these instructions
  and the rules that govern them were fraught with ambiguities\, preventing
  users of SPIR-V from understanding their purpose and hindering their use 
 by compiler developers. We used the Alloy modelling language and analysis 
 tool to build an initial best-effort formal model of SPIR-V control flow\,
  after which we iteratively refined the model by cross-checking it against
  official documentation\, test suites and validation tools\, consulting wi
 th experts in industry to resolve differences. Along the way we fixed nume
 rous deficiencies in these test suites and validation tools\, and ended up
  with agreement between our revised formal model and these other sources o
 f truth about SPIR-V. We then rewrote relevant parts of the English langua
 ge formal specification based on our rigorous formal model\, and our chang
 es to the language have been incorporated in the latest version of the SPI
 R-V specification. As an added bonus\, we devised a novel technique for au
 tomated testing of SPIR-V compilers that uses our formal model to generate
  unusual control flow graphs which are then fleshed out into self-checking
  SPIR-V test cases. This led to the discovery of numerous bugs affecting o
 pen source and commercial SPIR-V compilers.
