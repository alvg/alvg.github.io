 rser Equivalences for Causal Concurrency\n\nSpeaker: Azadeh Farzan\n\nAbst
 ract: In this talk\, I will discuss relaxations of trace equivalence with 
 the goal of maintaining its algorithmic advantages. Specifically\, for the
  problem of checking\, in a streaming setting\, if two arbitrary steps of 
 a concurrent program run are causally concurrent (i.e. they can be reorder
 ed in an equivalent run) or causally ordered (i.e. they always appear in t
 he same order in all equivalent runs)\, trace equivalence yields constant-
 space algorithms. I will discuss how certain relaxations\, provably\, do n
 ot yield similar efficient algorithms. Then\, I will introduce a new commu
 tativity-based notion of equivalence called grain equivalence that is stri
 ctly more relaxed than trace equivalence\, and yet yields a constant space
  algorithm for the same problem. This notion of equivalence uses commutati
 vity of grains\, which are sequences of atomic steps\, in addition to the 
 standard commutativity from trace theory. I will discuss two distinct case
 s when the grains are contiguous subwords of the input program run and whe
 n they are not\, formulate the precise definition of causal concurrency in
  each case\, and show that they can be decided in constant space\, despite
  being strict relaxations of the notion of causal concurrency based on tra
 ce equivalence.
