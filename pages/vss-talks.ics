 se: Proof-oriented Programming with Concurrent Separation Logic in F*\n\nS
 peaker: Nikhil Swamy\n\nAbstract: F* is a dependently typed programming la
 nguage. It has been used to develop more than a million lines of verified 
 code and proofs\, for artifacts ranging from cryptographic libraries to ne
 tworking components. Some of this verified software runs in widely used pr
 oduction systems\, ranging from the Windows kernel to the Python standard 
 library. However\, most of this corpus of verified code is purely sequenti
 al. Pulse is a new extension of F* enabling programming and proving impera
 tive programs with shared-memory concurrency. Proofs in Pulse are conducte
 d in a new program logic called PulseCore\, a concurrent separation logic 
 with state-of-the-art features\, including higher-order ghost state and im
 predicative invariants\, backed by a foundational semantics developed with
 in F* itself. Programs are verified in Pulse using a custom checker with a
  combination of tactics and SMT solving. Once proven\, programs in Pulse c
 an be extracted to OCaml\, C\, or Rust\, depending on the libraries and fe
 atures used. Pulse is being used in a number of new projects\, including i
 n the development of verified firmware\, in new libraries for secure data 
 formatting\, and for verified CPU/GPU programs. I will provide some backgr
 ound on F* and concurrent separation logic\, and then introduce Pulse by w
 ay of examples and a tool demonstration.
