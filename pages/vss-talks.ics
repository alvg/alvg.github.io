 ive learning of deterministic one-counter automata\n\nSpeaker: Sreejith A 
 V\n\nAbstract: Deterministic one-counter automata (DOCA) extend finite aut
 omata with a counter that can be incremented\, decremented or reset to zer
 o. The transition of a DOCA depends on the current state\, the letter\, an
 d whether the current counter value is zero. In an active learning framewo
 rk\, a Learner intends to learn a language by querying the Teacher with me
 mbership and equivalence queries. Angluin's classical L* algorithm showed 
 that in this framework\, a DFA can be learnt in polynomial time. In this t
 alk\, we are interested in the active learning of DOCA. All existing algor
 ithms for learning DOCA run in time exponential in the size of the minimal
  DOCA recognising the language. We present OL*\, the first active learning
  algorithm that learns a DOCA in polynomial time. This is a joint work wit
 h Prince Mathew and Vincent Penelle. arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.045
