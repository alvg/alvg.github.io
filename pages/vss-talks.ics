 ecurity problem for assertions\n\nSpeaker: S P Suresh\n\nAbstract: Securit
 y protocols underpin most aspects of our digital lives nowadays\, with fin
 ance\, health\, and even citizenship requiring some online interaction wit
 h remote servers over an insecure network\, and involving exchange of sens
 itive private information. Formal verification of such protocols has a lon
 g history of more than 40 years (and applied on many fundamental protocols
  like TLS and the Signal messaging protocol\, and various protocols for el
 ectronic voting\, e-commerce\, etc.). One of the central theoretical resul
 ts [Rusinowitch-Turuani (2003)] is that the problem of deciding if there i
 s a B-bounded attack on a given protocol is NP-complete\, for a fixed numb
 er B. A B-bounded attack is one which involves at most B messages and in w
 hich a secret is leaked to the malicious attacker. The technical challenge
  is that although the number of messages is bounded in such attacks\, the 
 size of each message is not. In recent work [Ramanujam-Sundararajan-Suresh
  (2024)] we extended the above NP-completeness result to protocols that in
 volve\, in addition to "traditional" messages themselves\, certificates or
  assertions of the form "the previous term that I sent is encrypted\, and 
 the term inside the encryption is a number between 1 to 10." In this talk\
 , we describe the insecurity problem\, and the solution by Rusinowitch-Tur
 uani (RT03)\, and show how we can extend the analysis of RT03 to our setti
 ng.
