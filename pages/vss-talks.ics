 ive learning of deterministic one-counter automata\n\nSpeaker: Sreejith A 
 V\n\nAbstract: The goal of explainability is to make sense of the decision
 s made by black-box ML models. Unfortunately\, many existing explanation m
 ethods are heuristic\, which makes them unreliable. In this talk\, I will 
 present our work on developing techniques that provide explanations with f
 ormal guarantees\, ensuring their trustworthiness. These techniques often 
 rely on formal verification\, particularly neural network verification too
 ls. In addition\, we examine these explanations from a theoretical perspec
 tive - studying the computational challenges they pose and exploring ways 
 to build practical tools that address these challenges and enable the gene
 ration of reliable explanations for ML models.
