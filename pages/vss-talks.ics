 lysis of incomplete programs via Proof Engines and Fuzzing\n\nSpeaker: Sub
 hajit Roy\n\nAbstract: We tackle the problem of testing and verifying "inc
 omplete" programs — that contain components whose source code is either 
 unavailable (like third-party libraries and cloud-based APIs)\, or too com
 plex to model formally (like large machine learning models). We show how c
 lassical techniques like symbolic execution\, deductive verification and S
 MT solving can be "lifted" to this setting. The techniques essentially emp
 loy a combination of automated SMT based proofs\, with tests from modern f
 uzzers for testing and "almost" verification of such programs. We will del
 ve into one of our contributions: Sādhak\, a solver for SMT theories modu
 lo closed-box functions. Our core idea is to use a synergistic combination
  of a fuzzer to reason on closed-box functions and an SMT engine to solve 
 the constraints pertaining to the SMT theories. The fuzz and the SMT engin
 es attempt to converge to a model by exchanging a rich set of interface co
 nstraints that are relevant and interpretable by them. Our implementation\
 , Sādhak\, demonstrates a significant advantage over the only other solve
 r that is capable of handling such closed-box constraints: Sādhak solves 
 36.45% more benchmarks than the best-performing mode of this state-of-the-
 art solver and has 5.72x better PAR-2 score\; on the benchmarks that are s
 olved by both tools\, Sādhak is (on an average) 14.62x faster.
