# icalendar (Web Calendar) links


Subscribing is recommended instead of Importing.
Subscribing will auto update the event, in case event timings change.
There would be a delay (usually no more than a day) your calendar getting updated.
The delay varies between Calender clients (expect 12H to 24H delay).

the iCalendar is a Common standard and should work with any Calendar client.
The GoogleCalendar and Outlook365 links are for convenience.

<!--
Also, subscribing as an "Other" calendar, or a "New" calendar (instead of adding to the primary calendar)
in Outlook will allow removing/hiding this easily from the view.


Subscribing to a calendar will automatically pull any updates to the event.
(dependeng on your calendar application, this may vary from once a couple of hours to about once a day).

Importing will download the `.ics` file, which if you open, should import into your calendar application.

If clicking the subscription link doesnt open up your email/calendar application to the subscription settings.  then copy the link and subscribe to the calendar).

Clicking on the https link will download an .ics file, which you can import into your email/calendar application.
(for one time addition of events to your calendar)
