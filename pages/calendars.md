# icalendar (Web Calendar) links


Subscribing is recommended instead of Importing.
Subscribing will auto update the event in your calendar, when the event is edited.
No need to update the event manually in your calendar.

**Note:** There would be a delay (usually no more than a day) for your calendar getting updated.
The delay varies between Calender clients (expect a 12h to 24h delay).

The `icalendar` is a Common standard and should work with any Calendar client.

**How to subscribe:** 
  Click on the iCalendar link. (May need to click/tap and hold for 2-3 seconds in some cases).
  If it is recognised by your device,
  your browser should open up your Calendar application showing the calendar subscription option.
  
**Subscribing manually:** If it was not recognised, you need to subscribe manually, as follows:
  Copy the iCalendar url, then in your Calendar Application, use the option to "Add a Calendar".
  Choose the "Web URL" option or "Subscribe" or "Internet calendar" option if there is one. Paste the iCalendar url. Done.

The `GoogleCalendar` and `Outlook365` links should make it a bit more convenient to subscribe using those clients.

<!--
Also, subscribing as an "Other" calendar, or a "New" calendar (instead of adding to the primary calendar)
in Outlook will allow removing/hiding this easily from the view.


Subscribing to a calendar will automatically pull any updates to the event.
(dependeng on your calendar application, this may vary from once a couple of hours to about once a day).

Importing will download the `.ics` file, which if you open, should import into your calendar application.

If clicking the subscription link doesnt open up your email/calendar application to the subscription settings.  then copy the link and subscribe to the calendar).

Clicking on the https link will download an .ics file, which you can import into your email/calendar application.
(for one time addition of events to your calendar)
