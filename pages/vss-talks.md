# iCalendar links


Using the Webcal link is recommended as it will auto update.

Also, subscribing as an "Other" calendar, or a "New" calendar (instead of adding to the primary calendar)
in Outlook will allow removing/hiding this easily from the view.

## webcal link (for subscribing this calendar)
[webcal://alvg.github.io/pages/vss-talks.ics](webcal://alvg.github.io/pages/vss-talks.ics)

## https link (for one time addition of events to your calendar)
